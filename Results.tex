\section{ALPs Runs}

We ran for two months, starting in the last week of November 2013. Over time several improvements and modifications to the system were made - they are detailed below.

PICTURE OF FREQUENCY COVERAGE OVER TIME

In the first run ,the week of Nov19-22, we ran with the digitizer being the NI-USB 5132. This had a deadtime of 60% meaning that it took 3 hrs to take a dataset with 1hrs worth of points. The tuning rod froze we believe to liquid nitrogen on the threads at the END OF THE WEEK?

The next week of Dec 03-07, we ran with the PCI-5114 card in place. 

The experimental setup for the runs up to Dec 18th had no RF switch in place on the strong port, meaning we had to take out the cable for the mixer and connect in the cable for the network analyzer, then disconnect the network analyzer cable and reconnect the mixer after each run. After Dec 18th, we put in an RF switch.

After January 23, we started putting in a test tone signal offset 3 MHz lower in frequency than the cavity resonance. After February 1st, we put in a second RF switch to switch between the test tone signal and the input signal of the network analyzer. 

For the weeks of Dec 13, Dec 16 and Jan 23rd, the temperature stability was bad and the helium consumption was very high. We ended up retaking many of these runs.
