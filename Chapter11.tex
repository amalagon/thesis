\section{Outlook and Future Directions}

Frequency scan rate goes as $(1/\vu)(d\vu/dt) \propto (B^4V^2)T^{-2}$ for fixed power sensitivity.

Power sensitivity goes as $g^2 \propto (B^2V)^{-1}T$ for fixed scan rate.

Reduce the system temperature. Standard quantum limit at 34 GHz is $kT_{SQL} \approx h\nu ~ 1 K$.

Increase magnetic field. For small cavities don't need large bore.
